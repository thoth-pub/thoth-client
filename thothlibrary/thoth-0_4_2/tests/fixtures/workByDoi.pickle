Based on over a decade of research and fieldwork in many disciplines\u2014including history and historiography; anthropology, ethnography, and ethnomusicology; political economy and geography; linguistics; philosophy; and the history of science and technology\u2014the book presented a radically different perspective than that presented by received opinion.\n\nGiven the radical and iconoclastic nature of Alcalay\u2019s perspective, After Jews and Arabs met great resistance in attempts to publish it. Though completed and already circulating in 1989, it didn\u2019t appear until 1993. In addition, when the book was published, there wasn\u2019t enough space to include its original bibliography, a foundational part of the project.\n\nA Bibliography for After Jews and Arabs presents the original bibliography, as completed in 1992, without changes, as a glimpse into the historical record of a unique scholarly, political, poetic, and cultural journey. The bibliography itself had roots in research begun in the late 1970s and demonstrates a very wide arc.\n\nIn addition to the bibliography, we include two accompanying texts here. In \u201cBehind the Scenes: Before After Jews and Arabs,\u201d Alcalay takes us behind the closed doors of the academic process, reprinting the original readers reports and his detailed rebuttals, and in \u201cOn a Bibliography for After Jews and Arabs,\u201d Alcalay contextualizes his own path to the work he undertook, in methodological, historical, and political terms.", "generalNote": null, "toc": null, "coverUrl": "https://punctumbooks.com/punctum/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/210106bibliographyafterjewsandarabs-cover-web-front.png", "coverCaption": null, "publications": [{"isbn": "978-1-953035-34-9", "publicationType": "PAPERBACK", "__typename": "Publication"}, {"isbn": "978-1-953035-35-6", "publicationType": "PDF", "__typename": "Publication"}], "subjects": [{"subjectId": "18ef6e1a-3cf0-4ae9-8e26-1e2666a84199", "subjectType": "BIC", "subjectCode": "1QRM", "subjectOrdinal": 2, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "d81108f6-706f-4015-a143-3f53bf28f388", "subjectType": "BIC", "subjectCode": "GBCR", "subjectOrdinal": 1, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "21b21084-b39f-4f1f-878e-a409cd96c282", "subjectType": "BISAC", "subjectCode": "REF004000", "subjectOrdinal": 1, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "fbbb53dd-ce27-41c9-aa47-1b814933e834", "subjectType": "THEMA", "subjectCode": "1QRM", "subjectOrdinal": 2, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "2179d522-57db-422d-b896-d701b101cee3", "subjectType": "THEMA", "subjectCode": "GBCR", "subjectOrdinal": 1, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "30e6e771-9fa9-4a90-8d34-5e96cdaeb69b", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "academic publishing", "subjectOrdinal": 3, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "462b5152-7b4b-468b-a437-655a30617c07", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "bibliography", "subjectOrdinal": 1, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "59a39718-044e-4d94-81a4-66dbd7f2e057", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "Charles Olson", "subjectOrdinal": 8, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "55375d4a-57ad-428d-a2cd-1eaee83da92b", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "Edward Dorn", "subjectOrdinal": 9, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "989106e8-6d6a-45bb-a1d2-4121dd1fb18a", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "Jews and Arabs", "subjectOrdinal": 2, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "de3a3476-4bbb-4664-a596-67d882763bb2", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "Levantine/Mediterranean", "subjectOrdinal": 5, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "b23d0dc7-9ead-422f-9f51-21e58942323c", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "Middle East", "subjectOrdinal": 4, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "653d3521-6119-44a8-b4d7-5786aa62313f", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "Palestine/Israel", "subjectOrdinal": 6, "__typename": "Subject"}, {"subjectId": "0e289e3b-ac31-4e97-b423-4b6dd2a2f2b5", "subjectType": "KEYWORD", "subjectCode": "poetics", "subjectOrdinal": 7, "__typename": "Subject"}], "contributions": [{"fullName": "Ammiel Alcalay", "contributionType": "AUTHOR", "mainContribution": true, "institution": null, "contributor": {"contributorId": "0e1f3e68-2fc8-452a-a1fe-6e1918be6186", "orcid": null, "firstName": "Ammiel", "lastName": "Alcalay", "fullName": "Ammiel Alcalay"}, "contributionId": "d664e9f3-892f-4770-876a-c267f85eaa20", "contributionOrdinal": 1, "__typename": "Contribution"}], "imprint": {"__typename": "Imprint", "publisher": {"publisherName": "punctum books", "publisherId": "9c41b13c-cecc-4f6a-a151-be4682915ef5", "__typename": "Publisher"}}, "__typename": "Work"}
